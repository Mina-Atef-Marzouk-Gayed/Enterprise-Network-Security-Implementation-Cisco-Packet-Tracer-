## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, a multi-network enterprise environment was built and secured, including routers, switches, servers, and firewall devices.

The implementation covers key security and network services such as:

- IP addressing and subnetting  
- Secure remote access using **SSH**
- Dynamic routing with **OSPF** + SHA-256 authentication  
- Switch security (Port Security, DHCP Snooping, BPDU Guard)  
- Site-to-site **IPsec VPN** tunnel  
- Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZPF)  
- Extended ACL firewall policies  
- Cisco ASA firewall configuration with NAT and DMZ  
- Centralized authentication using **RADIUS AAA**  
- Server services (DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, Email, Syslog)  
- SDN Controller integration for monitoring
